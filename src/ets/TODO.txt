Central Data-warehouse for reporting:
Reporting server that either connects and get all info form all Mother Node servers, or all servers push info to it

Connecting to multiple Compas Stations:

Single Mother node connected to multiple compas servers (case Pak/Afg)

To resolve: how to keep track of what Compas station to send dispatch/receipt to

Receipt from other Instance:
Manage receipt dispatched from other Mother Nodes
To resolve: how to keep track of what compas station to send dispatch/receipt to


The ETS application is a interface to COMPAS to create, print and update waybills 
The system connects periodically to COMPAS to retrieve LTIs (Landside Transport Instructions), and then allows a warehouse keeper to create a Waybill against these, this dispatched waybill is then pushed into COMPAS, the waybill has a barcode containing all the info of the waybill that can be used to do the reception of the waybill even if the receiving station has no connectivity.


How do you have a single select to select from two models in a django form
I have theese models:
OrderLine
StockItem
WaybillItem
Waybill

The Waybill constist of a number of WaybillItem connected to one Order Number

The WaybillItem consists of a OrderLine & a StockItem
The relation between StockItem & Orderline is a loose many to many dependent on a query from the data of the OrderLine:
 StockItem.objects.filter( wh_code = OrderLine.origin_wh_code ).filter( si_code = OrderLine.si_code ).filter( commodity_code = OrderLine.commodity_code )

In the form I would like the user to have a singel select to choose the possible options where for each matching StockItem/OrderLine there is one item

Example:
In OrderLines there is the following OrderLines:
Line_ID, OrderNumber, commodity_code, si_code, origin_wh_code
1001,1, Wheat, 2222,Rome
1002,1, Oat, 2222, Rome
1003,2, Oat, 2222, Rome

In StockItem you have:
Stock_ID, commodity_code, si_code, wh_code, reference_code
10, Wheat, 2222, Rome, 222201
12, Oat, 2222, Rome, 222202
13, Wheat, 2222, Rome, 222203
14, Wheat, 2222, Paris, 222203

This should result in a dropdown for waybillline for waybill with number 1 with:
Line_ID, Stock_ID, (commodity_code, si_code, reference_code)
1001,  10, (Wheat, 2222, 222201 
1001,  13, (Wheat, 2222, 222203)
1002,  12, (Oat,2222, 222202)

When selected the Waybill line should have both the Line_ID & Stock_ID saved, but the user is only using a single Dropdown.
I am using the inlineformset_factory to create the list of wabill lines

Can anyone help
